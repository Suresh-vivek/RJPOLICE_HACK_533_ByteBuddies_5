# Problem Statement:

- Automated AI/ML System for Detecting and Mitigating Online Fraud

# Objective:

- Create and implement an AI/ML-based system that can autonomously analyze and categorize online content, distinguishing between authentic and fake/fraudulent websites, advertisements, and customer care numbers. The system aims to achieve the following:

- Website Authentication:
  Develop algorithms to assess the legitimacy of websites based on domain, SSL certificates, and other authentication indicators.

- Ad Content Analysis:
  Implement NLP and image recognition techniques to evaluate the authenticity and accuracy of ad content.

- Customer Care Number Verification:
  Establish a database of verified customer care numbers and compare incoming numbers to identify potential scams.

- Real-time Detection:
  Enable real-time analysis of online content to prevent users from accessing fake or malicious websites.

- User Feedback Integration:
  Incorporate mechanisms for user feedback to enhance the system's accuracy and adapt to evolving fraudulent tactics.

# Background

The rapid growth of digital platforms has led to a surge in fraudulent activities, including deceptive websites, misleading ads, and scam customer care numbers. These activities pose risks such as financial losses, compromise of user data, and a decline in trust in online services. To safeguard consumers and ensure a secure digital environment, there is a pressing need for an AI/ML-based system capable of identifying and flagging fake/fraudulent online entities.

# Challenges:

- Escalation in the number of fraudulent websites.
- Continuous creation of new fraudulent entities with similar names.
- Diverse types of fraud, including deceptive shopping, job scams, etc.
- Adaptation to changes made by fraudulent websites and numbers.

# Proposed Solution:

An automated system utilizing freely available data, consumer forum inputs, website reviews, web scraping, and website analysis to identify dubious websites, forums, advertisements, or mobile apps and promptly report them to law enforcement.

# Expectations from the Solution/Tool:

- Utilize all relevant information sources, including openly available data, consumer forum inputs, website reviews, web scraping, and website analysis.
- Employ techniques such as URL reference flags, suspected domain history analysis, pixelated image detection, typos and inappropriate language recognition, assessment of poor website design, identification of bargain prices, limited contact details, complex/nonexistent return policies, and scrutiny of questionable payment options for identifying suspicious websites.
- Interface with the Cycaps portal to fetch data on fake/scam/mobile numbers used in criminal acts and cybercrime.
- Enhance user protection against scams and fraudulent actions.
- Timely discovery and mitigation of fraudulent content.
  Collaborate with authorities to dismantle fraudulent entities and prevent further harm.
- Promote consumer knowledge and awareness of legal rights.
